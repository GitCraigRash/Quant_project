How can I combine this with efficient ML?
My first thought is a credit card or ID situation where the prover is trying to make sure that the individual is truely the correct person.

What does this Paper achive?

Here is my current idea as to how to solve this: 
Find a library that does list-recovery
simulate a transmission to the device
return possible outcomes and evaluate time and accuracy.

Repeate but with quantum.

Goal: Set up problem set and run classical method as baseline before using quantum method.

Trying to understand how the probelm goes, I thought it was that the algorhtym identified errronous transmissions and corrected to the highest probability
but now I a questioning the entire setup of the problem. Because I don't know if the data is pariedied or not. I will look into the quantom solutino to see if there is any paritying.

I have desided to make entreies every 15m to improve my abilty to stay on track and then reflect every 45 minutes to 1 hour on my approch to the problems.

As of now I am trying to make a proper simulation of data transmitting and being restored by botha  classical and quantum algorythm.
